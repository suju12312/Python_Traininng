python is a centre of ml , ds, devops



H.b(user)
some prpgram can be there (programming language)
program --> operate hardw ware (o.s) can be win/linux
physical hardware --> can wifif,ram,hard disk,cpu

annaconda --> distro (python )

python does not know wat we want to connect

hb (sujal)  ---> send instructons ---> python progrm--> rntime
---> os  ----> phy harware


instrcton = statement ---> coding 
multiple line  = code
code can stored in files or program file sor source code
tell thje requiremt = developer
python propgram connect weith os that is known as runtime
python understqnd python programming language not human language

window --> cmd prompt 


type

python
see first.py for code
every program language has own keyword

print -- it print whatever written in black termin al
memory == brains == ram
ram is also physical devices
keep memory is known as data
x=20  (associate or link with variable x)
variable is also knoiwn as reference
age is a variable not a strng age =32
how python know x is variable or not so writee 
print("x")

x is varable = put data 5

if do so what happen ?  somewhere in ram datta called 5 stored in x variable ( inside ram)

all data will remove if power off
storage = hard disk = permanent / persistent
x = 5  equal to means stored in ram where to stored 

q? data load on the ram proof?
if you terminatew ands open shell thwen  it will loss data but in ram it might possible there is no loss of data
it still there in ram jusrt know how to read a ram
Task: how to read the main memory also known as ram?

python give us a live interpreter is knowen as repl
r = read p = print e = evaluate l = loop

list in python = ["arun" ,"harhsh", "rahul"]
organize lot of data in one placeknown as data structure

 List is not data type 
 if we want to add somethng known as append
 python.append("vimal")
 if want to see len then len(python)
if want to swee start from zero index to third index give data known as slice operators
print("rahul" in python) (t find something then)


print(python[-1])
#op:sujal
agar last meeber pata karna hai tho ye karne ka
print(python[-3:])
print(python[:])  ---> python[::1] 1 means adding one now

every dtaa structure has functionaltis

dir(python)
help(python.append)
help(python.insert)

db.insert(2, "pop")

db[start:end:jump]
